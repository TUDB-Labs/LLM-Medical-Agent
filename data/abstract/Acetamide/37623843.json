Increased body\nmass index (BMI) during adolescence carries significant long-term adverse\nhealth outcomes, including chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease,\nstroke, diabetes, and cancer. Little is known about the metabolic consequences\nof changes in BMI in adolescents outside of typical clinical parameters. Here,\nwe used untargeted metabolomics to assess changing BMI in male adolescents.\nUntargeted metabolomic profiling was performed on urine samples from 360\nadolescents using UPLC-QTOF-MS. The study includes a baseline of 235 subjects\nin a discovery set and 125 subjects in a validation set. Of them, a follow-up\nof 81 subjects (1 year later) as a replication set was studied. Linear\nregression analysis models were used to estimate the associations of metabolic\nfeatures with BMI z-score in the discovery and validation sets, after\nadjusting for age, race, and total energy intake (kcal) at false-discovery-\nrate correction (FDR) â‰¤ 0.1. We identified 221 and 16 significant metabolic\nfeatures in the discovery and in the validation set, respectively. The\nmetabolites associated with BMI z-score in validation sets are glycylproline,\ncitrulline, 4-vinylsyringol, 3'-sialyllactose, estrone sulfate, carnosine,\nformiminoglutamic acid, 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxyprolyl-asparagine,\n2-hexenoylcarnitine, L-glutamine, inosine, N-(2-Hydroxyphenyl) acetamide\nglucuronide, and galactosylhydroxylysine. Of those 16 features, 9 significant\nmetabolic features were associated with a positive change in BMI in the\nreplication set 1 year later. Histidine and arginine metabolism were the most\naffected metabolic pathways. Our findings suggest that obesity and its\nmetabolic outcomes in the urine metabolome of children are linked to altered\namino acids, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. These identified metabolites\nmay serve as biomarkers and aid in the investigation of obesity's underlying\npathological mechanisms. Whether these features are associated with the\ndevelopment of obesity, or a consequence of changing BMI, requires further\nstudy.\n\n"}
