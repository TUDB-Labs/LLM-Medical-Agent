{"title": "Modafinil\n\n", "doi": "NBK513058\n\n", "time": "\n\n", "abstract": "Little information is available on the excretion of modafinil into breastmilk.\nIn the case reports available, only R-modafinil was measured. R-enantiomer is\nthe predominant form (about 75%) in the blood after administration of racemic\nmodafinil, but not measuring S-modafinil in those reports likely led to an\nunderreporting of the total amount in milk and exposure in the infant.[1,2]\nNevertheless, milk levels of R-modafinil in two nursing mothers and serum of\none breastfed infant were very low. Some information from women who breastfed\ntheir infants while using modafinil found no adverse effects in the infants.\nUntil more safety data are available, modafinil should be used with careful\ninfant monitoring during breastfeeding, or an alternate drug may be preferred.\n\n"}
