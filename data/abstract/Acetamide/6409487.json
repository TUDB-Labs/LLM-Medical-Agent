In 4 of 19 patients, all with a variety of serious diseases, a range\nfrom impaired to total failure of neutrophilic phagocytic and metabolic\noxidative activities was detected by the test. Piracetam, as shown by\nqualitative methods, restored to optimal activity the two impaired neutrophil\nfunctions in these 4 patients. Quantitative techniques are available currently\nto establish the beneficial effect of Piracetam on such defective neutrophils.\nPiracetam merits additional study to determine its efficacy in enhancement of\nrestorative effects on compromised neutrophils which have been observed. The\nclinical promise of this investigation offers benefit to some patients now\njeopardized by certain stressful diseases in part due to agonal failure of\nneutrophils.\n\n"}
