The results demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of the ie-1\npromoter was increased to a certain extent by different insect hormone\ntreatments in uninfected insect cells or fifth instar silkworm larvae\ntransfected with a plasmid containing a luciferase gene driven by the ie-1\npromoter. By ecdysone treatment alone, an increase of 5-7 fold was reached in\nBm-N, or Bm-5 cells, or in the early developmental stage of fifth instar\nlarvae. By treatment with juvenile hormone analogue alone, about 2-fold, in\nBm-N, Bm-5, and Sf-21 cells, or about 5-fold increase in the middle\ndevelopmental stage of larvae was given, respectively. By co-treatment with\necdysone and juvenile hormone analogue, the incease was given between that of\necdysone and juvenile hormone analogue treatment alone. In addition, the\nsynergistic effects of foreign/endogenous hormones on the activity of ie-1\npromoter are discussed.\n\n"}
