In vivo micro-positron emission\ntomography (PET)/computed tomography imaging has been utilized as a minimally\ninvasive method to detect anesthetic-induced neuronal adverse effects in\nanimal studies. Methods: Neonatal rhesus monkeys (postnatal day 5 or 6, 3 to 6\nper group) were exposed for 8 h to 2.5% sevoflurane with or without acetyl-L-\ncarnitine (ALC). Control monkeys were exposed to room air with or without ALC.\nPhysiologic status was monitored throughout exposures. Depth of anesthesia was\nmonitored using quantitative electroencephalography. After the exposure,\nmicroPET/computed tomography scans using F-labeled\nfluoroethoxybenzyl-N-(4-phenoxypyridin-3-yl) acetamide (FEPPA) were performed\nrepeatedly on day 1, 1 and 3 weeks, and 2 and 6 months after exposure.\nResults: Critical physiologic metrics in neonatal monkeys remained within the\nnormal range during anesthetic exposures. The uptake of [F]-FEPPA in the\nfrontal and temporal lobes was increased significantly 1 day or 1 week after\nexposure, respectively. Analyses of microPET images recorded 1 day after\nexposure showed that sevoflurane exposure increased [F]-FEPPA uptake in the\nfrontal lobe from 0.927 ± 0.04 to 1.146 ± 0.04, and in the temporal lobe from\n0.859 ± 0.05 to 1.046 ± 0.04 (mean ± SE, P < 0.05). Coadministration of ALC\neffectively blocked the increase in FEPPA uptake. Sevoflurane-induced adverse\neffects were confirmed by histopathologic evidence as well. Conclusions:\nSevoflurane-induced general anesthesia during development increases glial\nactivation, which may serve as a surrogate for neurotoxicity in the nonhuman\nprimate brain. ALC is a potential protective agent against some of the adverse\neffects associated with such exposures.\n\n"}
