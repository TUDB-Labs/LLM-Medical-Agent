The median time of wound healing for the Hyphecan group was 12\ndays with an average of 13.1+/-4.0 days (ranged from 9 to 28 days) while the\nKaltostat group had a median healing time of 12 days (ranged from 8 to 28\ndays) with a mean of 13.0+/-4.1 days. The difference in healing time between\nthese two groups was statistically insignificant with a P-value of 0.95. The\ninfection rate was 2.9% for both Hyphecan and Kaltostat. These 35 patients had\nbeen followed up from 10 to 16 months and no difference in long-term donor\nsite morbidity between Hyphecan and Kaltostat had been observed. This finding\nwas encouraging because the cost of Hyphecan is less than 50% of Kaltostat and\nit may be worthwhile to explore the clinical application of Hyphecan in other\narea of burns treatment.\n\n"}
