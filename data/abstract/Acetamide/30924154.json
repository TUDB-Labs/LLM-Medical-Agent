In human hepatocytes, [14\nC]DSP-0565 was primarily metabolized via amide bond hydrolysis to\n(2'-fluoro[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-yl)acetic acid (M8), while in rat and dog\nhepatocytes, it was primarily metabolized via both hydrolysis to M8 and\nhydroxylation at the benzene ring or the benzyl site to oxidized metabolites.\nAfter single oral administration of [14 C]DSP-0565 to rats and dogs, the major\nradioactivity fraction was recovered in the urine (71-72% of dose) with a much\nsmaller fraction recovered in feces (23-25% of dose). As primary metabolites\nin their excreta, M8, oxidized metabolites, and glucuronide of DSP-0565 were\ndetected. The contribution of metabolic pathways was estimated from metabolite\nprofiles in their excreta: the major metabolic pathway was oxidation (57-62%)\nand the next highest was the hydrolysis pathway (23-33%). These results\nsuggest that there are marked species differences in the metabolic pathways of\nDSP-0565 between humans and animals. Finally, DSP-0565 human oral clearance\n(CL/F) was predicted using in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) with/without\nanimal scaling factors (SF, in vivo intrinsic clearance/in vitro intrinsic\nclearance). The SF improved the underestimation of IVIVE (fold error = 0.22),\nbut the prediction was overestimated (fold error = 2.4-3.3). In contrast, the\nuse of SF for hydrolysis pathway was the most accurate for the prediction\n(fold error = 1.0-1.4). Our findings suggest that understanding of species\ndifferences in metabolic pathways between humans and animals is important for\npredicting human metabolic clearance when using animal SF.\n\n"}
