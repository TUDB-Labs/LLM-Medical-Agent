Studies based\non egg sizes and brooding times of deep-sea and polar octopods support this\nhypothesis, but empirical data on growth are still scarce. To test the\nhypothesis that octopods inhabiting cold waters (< 3Â°C) live longer than\ntemperate and warm water species, this study investigated size-at-age,\nmaturation and growth rates in incirrate Antarctic octopods. Octopod age was\nestimated via the interpretation and quantification of beak growth increments,\nwhich in shallow water octopods have been validated to be formed on a daily\nbasis. Specimens from the families Megaleledonidae (Adelieledone spp.,\nPareledone spp. and Megaleledone setebos) and Enteroctopodidae (Muusoctopus\nrigbyae) were collected on the shelf and slope regions off the Antarctic\nPeninsula during a cruise in 2012. Examined specimens included early juveniles\nto animals in advanced maturity. The total number of growth increments ranged\nfrom 192-599 in Pareledone aequipapillae (body mass [BM] 2-109 g), 182-431 in\nPareledone charcoti (BM 5-124 g), 98-906 in M. setebos (BM 10-6000 g) and\n207-425 in M. rigbyae (BM 24-256 g). After the cruise, eleven specimens of P.\ncharcoti were kept alive in captivity for more than 12 months and these\nanimals had 219-364 growth increments, suggesting that increment formation in\nthis species takes longer than one day. The complex population structure\n(size, age and maturity range) of the specimens that were captured during a\nrelatively short time, the number of beak increments quantified, and the\npreliminary validation observations indicate that Antarctic octopods do not\ndeposit increments daily, and may have lifespans exceeding 3 years. These\nfindings corroborate the general trend that cold water molluscs have a longer\nlifespan than their warm water relatives.\n\n"}
