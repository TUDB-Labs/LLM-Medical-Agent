The study aims to explore the relationship\nof habitual food intake with blood and urine metabolites in adolescents and\nyoung adults. Methods: The study population comprises 228 participants (94\nmales and 134 females) of the DONALD study. Dietary intake is assessed by\nyearly repeated 3d-food records. Habitual diet is estimated as the average\nconsumption of 23 food groups in adolescence. Using an untargeted metabolomics\napproach, the study quantifies 2638 metabolites in plasma and 1407 metabolites\nin urine. In each sex, unique diet-metabolite associations using orthogonal\nprojection to latent structures (oPLS) and random forests (RF) is determined.\nResults: Six metabolites in agreement between oPLS and RF in urine, one in\nfemale (vanillylmandelate to processed/other meat) and five in males\n(indole-3-acetamide, and N6-methyladenosine to eggs; hippurate,\ncitraconate/glutaconate, and X - 12111 to vegetables) are observed. No\nassociation in blood in agreement is observed. Conclusion: A limited\nreflection of habitual food group intake by single metabolites in urine and\nnot in blood is observed. The explored biomarkers should be confirmed in\nadditional studies.\n\n"}
