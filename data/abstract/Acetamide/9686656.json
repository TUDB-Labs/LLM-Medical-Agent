{"title": "The clinical indications for identical pathogenesis of isolated and non-\nisolated testicular relapses in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\n\n", "doi": "10.1080/080352598750014049\n\n", "time": "1998 Jun;87(6):638-43.\n\n", "abstract": "In the present population-based study, we compared the clinical data of\ntesticular relapses with and without concurrent bone marrow relapse and\nclinical data of the relapses in other locations among boys with acute\nlymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), in order to study the possible evidence of\nearly sequestration and local regulation of leukaemic lymphoblast in the\ntestis of humans. The results suggest that the pathogenesis of isolated\ntesticular relapse (T) and testicular relapse with a concurrent bone marrow\nrelapse (T + BM) is likely to be similar. Isolated and non-isolated testicular\nrelapses appeared late after the achievement of remission (T 34 +/- 16 months,\nT + BM 32 +/- 15 months) in ALL compared to relapses in other locations (CNS\n23 +/- 11 months, BM 25 +/- 19 months). The better prognosis after testicular\nrelapses (estimated second event free survival probability, 2-EFS: T 0.63, T +\nBM 0.32) compared to bone marrow relapse (2-EFS: BM 0.13) further suggests\nthat testicular relapse with a concurrent bone marrow relapse possibly\noriginates from the isolated testicular relapse, and that the isolated\ntesticular relapse is a separate entity and not a manifestation of systemic\nrecurrence. Higher frequencies of isolated and non-isolated testicular\nrelapses (T 9%, T + BM 5%) were observed among boys with onset of ALL in early\npuberty (10-12 y) compared to those among younger (T 4%, T + BM 2%) and older\n(T 0%, T + BM 0%) boys. The late occurrence, the possible association with\nhormonal maturation and the good prognosis after testicular relapses suggest a\npossible local regulation of the residual leukaemic lymphoblast in human\ntestis.\n\n"}
