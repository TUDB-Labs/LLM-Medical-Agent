Dosage\nranged from 2 to 6 mg BS 100--141 and from 0.3 to 0.9 mg clonidine daily in\ntwo or three divided doses. Both compounds caused a significant and comparable\nfall in blood pressure. Patients whose blood pressure was not reduced to\nnormal levels by 2 to 3 mg BS 100--141 daily did not respond better to an\nincrease in the dose. Dry mouth and constipation occurred about equally\nfrequently with both agents, but sedation and orthostatic circulatory effects\nwere considerably more frequent with clonidine. Rebound hypertension likewise\noccurred in five patients following clonidine withdrawal as opposed to no\npatient after BS 100-141.\n\n"}
