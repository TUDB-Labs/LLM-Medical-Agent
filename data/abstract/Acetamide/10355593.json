Androgenized rats exhibited an increase\nof prolactin secretion with higher serum circulating levels in the afternoon\n(1800) than in the morning (1000). The administration of the opioid antagonist\nnaloxone (2 mg/kg, 30 min before decapitation) reduced serum prolactin levels\nin both groups. To identify the opioid receptor subtypes involved in this\nregulation, opioid agonists were administered i.c.v. 15 min before the\ndecapitation (1000). The mu-opioid receptor agonist DAMGO ([D-Ala2, NMe-Phe4,\nGly5-ol]-enkephalin) caused a significant increase in serum prolactin\nconcentration. The selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist U-50, 488H\n(trans-(+/-)-3,4-dichloro-N-[2(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]-benzene acetamide\nmethane sulfonate salt) induced a small but significant increase in serum\nprolactin levels but no effect was observed after administration of the delta-\nopioid agonist DPDPE ([D-Pen2, D-Pen5]-enkephalin). The role of oestradiol and\nthe opioid system in the continuous secretion of prolactin was also study.\nChronic gonadectomy (3-4 weeks) reduced serum prolactin concentrations\nmeasured at 1000 but the administration of naloxone had no effect. Three days\nof oestrogen treatment (2 microg/rat in oil) restored serum prolactin levels\ncompared with ovariectomized animals and this effect was abolished by naloxone\ntreatment. Interestingly, acute ovariectomy or administration of tamoxifen to\nintact androgenized rats did not prevent the continuous secretion of prolactin\nobserved in these animals and naloxone treatment reduced serum prolactin\nlevels in both groups of rats. We also examine the participation of adrenal\nprogesterone and the endogenous opioid peptides on the regulation of prolactin\nlevels in androgenized rats. After adrenalectomy, no changes in serum\nprolactin levels (1000) were observed compared with the control animal and\nnaloxone treatment significantly reduced circulating prolactin levels.\nProgesterone treatment to intact androgenized rats significantly increased\nprolactin levels and the administration of naloxone blocked the stimulatory\neffect of the steroid. These results suggest that the opioid system play a\nrole in the regulation of prolactin secretion in androgenized rats modulated\nby the persistence of oestrogen action. Moreover, the presence or absence of\nprogesterone did not modify the regulation of prolactin secretion by the\nopioids. The mu- and kappa-opioid receptor subtypes are the ones involved in\nthe modulation of pituitary prolactin secretion.\n\n"}
