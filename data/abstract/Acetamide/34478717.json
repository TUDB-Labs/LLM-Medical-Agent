Neuroblastoma (NB), in turn, is the most common extracranial solid\ntumor in childhood. In the present study, we sought to compare FC and\nanatomopathological examination (PA) / immunohistochemistry (IHC) of children\ndiagnosed or suspected with NB. The median age was 59 months (minimum 0;\nmaximum 325 months), of these 12 were male (57.1%, 12/21). Forty-eight samples\n(27 bone marrow (BM), 10 peripheral blood (PB), 8 primary tumors (PT) and 2\nliver nodules (HN) and 1 rib fragment (RF)) from 21 patients were evaluated.\nTwenty-nine samples were from patients with clinical suspicion while 19\nsamples were from patients with previously confirmed diagnosis. Thirteen\nsamples (7 BM, 5 PT and 1 HN) presented NB when analyzed in FC while 8 (3 BM\nand 5 PT) samples were positive for NB in the PA/IHC. They were concordant in\n88.9% of the cases. No NB cells were identified in any PB. Considering the PA\nas the gold standard, the FC obtained a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of\n86%, a positive predictive value of 67% and a negative predictive value of\n100%. This study demonstrates that FC can be used as a methodology for\ndiagnosis and assessment of NB involvement. In addition, FC has the advantage\nof allowing a quick diagnosis and accurate classification of the disease, and\ncan also assist in monitoring the treatment.\n\n"}
