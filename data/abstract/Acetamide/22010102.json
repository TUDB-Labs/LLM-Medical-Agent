{"title": "Risk factors for acute GVHD and survival after hematopoietic cell\ntransplantation\n\n", "doi": "PMC3251233\n\n", "time": "2012 Jan 5;119(1):296-307.\n\n", "abstract": "Risk factors for acute GVHD (AGVHD), overall survival, and transplant-related\nmortality were evaluated in adults receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell\ntransplants (1999-2005) from HLA-identical sibling donors (SDs; n = 3191) or\nunrelated donors (URDs; n = 2370) and reported to the Center for International\nBlood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN. To understand the\nimpact of transplant regimen on AGVHD risk, 6 treatment categories were\nevaluated: (1) myeloablative conditioning (MA) with total body irradiation\n(TBI) + PBSCs, (2) MA + TBI + BM, (3) MA + nonTBI + PBSCs, (4) MA + nonTBI +\nBM, (5) reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) + PBSCs, and (6) RIC + BM. The\ncumulative incidences of grades B-D AGVHD were 39% (95% confidence interval\n[CI], 37%-41%) in the SD cohort and 59% (95% CI, 57%-61%) in the URD cohort.\nPatients receiving SD transplants with MA + nonTBI + BM and RIC + PBSCs had\nsignificantly lower risks of grades B-D AGVHD than patients in other treatment\ncategories. Those receiving URD transplants with MA + TBI + BM, MA + nonTBI +\nBM, RIC + BM, or RIC + PBSCs had lower risks of grades B-D AGVHD than those in\nother treatment categories. The 5-year probabilities of survival were 46% (95%\nCI, 44%-49%) with SD transplants and 33% (95% CI, 31%-35%) with URD\ntransplants. Conditioning intensity, TBI and graft source have a combined\neffect on risk of AGVHD that must be considered in deciding on a treatment\nstrategy for individual patients.\n\n"}
