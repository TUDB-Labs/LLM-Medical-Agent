{"title": "Comparative plasma pharmacokinetics of ceftiofur sodium and ceftiofur\ncrystalline-free acid in neonatal calves\n\n", "doi": "10.1111/jvp.12275\n\n", "time": "2016 Jun;39(3):271-6.\n\n", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare the plasma pharmacokinetic profile\nof ceftiofur crystalline-free acid (CCFA) and ceftiofur sodium in neonatal\ncalves between 4 and 6 days of age. In one group (n = 7), a single dose of\nCCFA was administered subcutaneously (SQ) at the base of the ear at a dose of\n6.6 mg/kg of body weight. In a second group (n = 7), a single dose of\nceftiofur sodium was administered SQ in the neck at a dose of 2.2 mg/kg of\nbody weight. Concentrations of desfuroylceftiofur acetamide (DCA) in plasma\nwere determined by HPLC. Median time to maximum DCA concentration was 12 h\n(range 12-48 h) for CCFA and 1 h (range 1-2 h) for ceftiofur sodium. Median\nmaximum plasma DCA concentration was significantly higher for calves given\nceftiofur sodium (5.62 μg/mL; range 4.10-6.91 μg/mL) than for calves given\nCCFA (3.23 μg/mL; range 2.15-4.13 μg/mL). AUC0-∞ and Vd/F were significantly\ngreater for calves given CCFA than for calves given ceftiofur sodium. The\nmedian terminal half-life of DCA in plasma was significantly longer for calves\ngiven CCFA (60.6 h; range 43.5-83.4 h) than for calves given ceftiofur sodium\n(18.1 h; range 16.7-39.7 h). Cl/F was not significantly different between\ngroups. The duration of time median plasma DCA concentrations remained above\n2.0 μg/mL was significantly longer in calves that received CCFA (84.6 h; range\n48-103 h) as compared to calves that received ceftiofur sodium (21.7 h; range\n12.6-33.6 h). Based on the results of this study, CCFA administered SQ at a\ndose of 6.6 mg/kg in neonatal calves provided plasma concentrations above the\ntherapeutic target of 2 μg/mL for at least 3 days following a single dose. It\nis important to note that the use of ceftiofur-containing products is\nrestricted by the FDA and the use of CCFA in veal calves is strictly\nprohibited.\n\n"}
