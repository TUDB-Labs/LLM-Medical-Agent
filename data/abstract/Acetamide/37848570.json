{"title": "Effects of combined training or moderate intensity continuous training during\na 3-week multidisciplinary body weight reduction program on cardiorespiratory\nfitness, body composition, and substrate oxidation rate in adolescents with\nobesity\n\n", "doi": "PMC10582026\n\n", "time": "2023 Oct 17;13(1):17609.\n\n", "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of combined training (COMB, a\ncombination of moderate-intensity continuous training-MICT and high-intensity\ninterval training-HIIT) vs. continuous MICT administered during a 3-week in-\nhospital body weight reduction program (BWRP) on body composition, physical\ncapacities, and substrate oxidation in adolescents with obesity. The 3-week\nin-hospital BWRP entailed moderate energy restriction, nutritional education,\npsychological counseling, and two different protocols of physical exercise.\nTwenty-one male adolescents with obesity (mean age: 16.1 ± 1.5 years; mean\nbody mass index [BMI] 37.8 ± 4.5 kg m-2) participated in this randomized\ncontrol trial study (n:10 for COMB, n:11 MICT), attending ~ 30 training\nsessions. The COMB group performed 3 repetitions of 2 min at 95% of peak\noxygen uptake (V'O2 peak) (e.g., HIIT ≤ 20%), followed by 30 min at 60% of\nV'O2 peak (e.g., MICT ≥ 80%). Body composition, V'O2 peak, basal metabolic\nrate (BMR), energy expenditure, and substrate oxidation rate were measured\nduring the first week (W0) and at the end of three weeks of training (W3). The\ntwo training programs were equivalent in caloric expenditure. At W3, body mass\n(BM) and fat mass (FM) decreased significantly in both groups, although the\ndecrease in BM was significantly greater in the MICT group than in the COMB\ngroup (BM: - 5.0 ± 1.2 vs. - 8.4 ± 1.5, P < 0.05; FM: - 4.3 ± 3.0 vs. - 4.2 ±\n1.9 kg, P < 0.05). V'O2 peak increased only in the COMB by a mean of 0.28 ±\n0.22 L min-1 (P < 0.05). The maximal fat oxidation rate (MFO) increased only\nin the COMB group by 0.04 ± 0.03 g min-1 (P < 0.05). COMB training represents\na viable alternative to MICT for improving anthropometric characteristics,\nphysical capacities, and MFO in adolescents with obesity during a 3-week in-\nhospital BWRP.\n\n"}
