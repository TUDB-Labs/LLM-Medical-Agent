In this study,\nthe drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of\nN-(1-{(3R)-3-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-3-[4-methanesulfonylphenyl]propyl}piperidin-4-yl)-N-ethyl-2-[4-methanesulfonylphenyl]acetamide\n(AZD5672) was assessed accordingly, and a subsequent clinical digoxin\ninteraction study was performed. AZD5672 (1-500 μM) demonstrated\nconcentration-dependent efflux across cell monolayers, which was abolished in\nthe presence of ketoconazole and quinidine, identifying AZD5672 as a P-gp\nsubstrate. In addition, P-gp-mediated digoxin transport was inhibited in a\nconcentration-dependent manner by AZD5672 (IC(50) = 32 μM). Assessment of the\ncalculated theoretical gastrointestinal inhibitor concentration ([I(2)]) and\npredicted steady-state maximum total plasma inhibitor concentration ([I(1)])\nindicated the potential for a DDI at the intestinal but not the systemic level\nafter the predicted therapeutic dose of AZD5672 (100 mg). A clinical study was\nperformed and the plasma pharmacokinetics [observed maximum plasma drug\nconcentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration versus time\ncurve from 0 to 72 h postdose (AUC(0-72 h))] of orally dosed digoxin (0.5 mg)\nwere found to be unaffected by coadministration of AZD5672 (50 mg) at steady\nstate. In contrast, a 150-mg dose of AZD5672 significantly increased digoxin\nC(max) and AUC(0-72 h) by 1.82- and 1.33-fold, respectively. Concentration-\ntime profile comparisons indicated that digoxin elimination was unchanged by\nAZD5672, and the interaction was most likely to have resulted from inhibition\nof intestinal P-gp leading to increased digoxin absorption. The observed dose-\ndependent clinically significant interaction was accurately predicted using\ncalculated [I(2)] and in vitro P-gp inhibition data, confirming AZD5672 to be\na P-gp inhibitor in vivo.\n\n"}
