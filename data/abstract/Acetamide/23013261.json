{"title": "Toxicology of dimethyl and monomethyl derivatives of acetamide and formamide:\na second update\n\n", "doi": "10.3109/10408444.2012.725028\n\n", "time": "2012 Nov;42(10):793-826.\n\n", "abstract": "Dimethylacetamide (DMAC) and dimethylformamide (DMF) continue to be important,\nwidely used solvents involved in a wide variety of industrial applications. As\nliquids with relatively low vapor pressures, contact with both the\nintegumentary and respiratory systems is the main source of human exposure.\nAlthough airborne control levels for the workplace have been established and\nindustrial hygiene practices to limit dermal contact have been put in place,\nuse of these chemicals has been associated with occupational illness, mainly\nin Asia where new and expanded uses have led to overexposures. Thus an update\nof the basic toxicology data including tables indicating the dose/exposure\nresponse characteristics of both DMAC and DMF is currently important. Both\nchemicals are similar from a toxicology perspective. Human experience has\ngenerally shown the materials to be without adverse effect except under\nconditions where airborne and dermal controls were not properly applied. The\nuse of urinary metabolite monitoring has successfully been employed to measure\nintegrated dermal and inhalation worker exposure. The chemicals are not\nparticularly toxic following acute exposure but high doses can produce damage\nto the liver, the organ which is first affected by these two chemicals.\nRepeated dose/exposure studies have characterized both the targets of toxicity\nand the doses required to produce changes by various routes of exposure.\nHigher doses of these materials can produce changes in developing systems,\ninfrequently in experiments at doses in which the maternal animal is\nunaffected, thus care needs to be taken when exposures are to women of child-\nbearing age. The chemicals appear to be low in genetic activity and inhalation\nexposures have not shown the materials to produce tumors in rodents except\nwith DMF in a situation in which aerosol formation was encountered. This\npresentation extends the two previous reviews and, like those, includes\nupdated information on acetamide and formamide and their monomethyl\nderivatives as well as the commercially important DMAC and DMF. Since a large\nportion of the newer information deals with effects in humans and\nbiomonitoring, these sections are presented at the start of this review.\n\n"}
