Group 1 calves were fed\nunmedicated milk replacer until 30 days of age and were then converted to the\nsame roughag/concentrate diet as Group 2. Groups 1-IV and 2-IV received\nceftiofur sodium IV, and Groups 1-IM and 2-IM received ceftiofur sodium IM.\nGroup 1 calves were dosed at 7 days of age and at 1 and 3 months of age; group\n2 calves were dosed at 6 and 9 months of age. Blood samples were obtained\nserially from each calf, and plasma samples were analysed using an HPLC assay\nthat converts ceftiofur and all desfuroylceftiofur metabolites to\ndesfuroylceftiofur acetamide. Cmax values were similar in all calves, and were\nno higher in younger calves than in older calves. Plasma concentrations\nremained above 0.150 microgram ceftiofur free acid equivalents/mliter for 72 h\nin 7-day-old calves, but were less than 0.150 microgram/mliter within 48 h\nfollowing IV or IM injection for 6- and 9-month-old calves. Intramuscular\nbioavailability, assessed by comparing the model-derived area under the curve\n(AUCmod) from IM and IV injection at each age, appeared to be complete. After\nIV administration, the AUCmod in 7-day-old and 1-month-old calves (126.92 +/-\n21.1 micrograms.h/mliter and 135.0 +/- 21.6 micrograms.h/mliter, respectively)\nwas significantly larger than in 3-, 6- and 9-month-old calves (74.0 +/- 10.7\nmicrograms.h/mliter, 61.0 +/- 17.7 micrograms.h/mliter and 68.5 +/- 12.8\nmicrograms.h/mliter, respectively; P < 0.0001). The Vd(ss) decreased linearly\nwithin the first 3 months of life in cattle (0.345 +/- 0.0616 L/kg, 0.335 +/-\n0.919 L/kg and 0.284 +/- 0.0490 L/kg, respectively; P = 0.031), indicative of\nthe decreasing extracellular fluid volume in maturing cattle. The ClB was\nsignificantly smaller in 7-day-old and 1-month-old calves (0.0178 +/- 0.00325\nL/h.kg and 0.0167 +/- 0.00310 L/h.kg, respectively) than in 3-, 6- and\n9-month-old calves (0.0303 +/- 0.0046 L/h.kg, 0.0398 +/- 0.0149 L/h.kg and\n0.0330 +/- 0.00552 L/h.kg, respectively; P < or = 0.001). This observation may\nbe indicative of maturation of the metabolism and/or excretion processes for\nceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofur metabolites. The approved dosage regimens for\nceftiofur sodium of 1.1-2.2 mg/kg administered once daily for up to 5\nconsecutive days will provide plasma concentrations above the MIC for bovine\nrespiratory disease pathogens for a longer period of time in neonatal calves\nthan in older calves. Peak plasma concentrations of ceftiofur and\ndesfuroylceftiofur metabolites were no higher in neonatal calves than in more\nmature cattle, highly suggestive that peak tissue concentrations would be no\nhigher in neonatal calves than in more mature cattle.\n\n"}
