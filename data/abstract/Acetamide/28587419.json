Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided in the\nnewborn air group, newborn hyperoxia group and newborn intervention group, the\nlatter of which was administered the chymotrypsin inhibitor,\n2-(5-formylamino-6-oxo-2-phenyl-1,\n6-dihydropyrimidine-1-yl)-N-[4-dioxo-1-phenyl-7-(2-pyridyloxy)] 2-heptyl-\nacetamide (NK3201). A group of adult rats also received hyperoxic treatment.\nHistomorphological changes in lung tissues were dynamically observed. AngII,\nROS, angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) and p22phox messenger RNA (mRNA)\nlevels, and OGG1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ)\nprotein levels in the lung tissues were detected at various times after\nhyperoxia. Hyperoxia led to traumatic changes in the lungs of newborn rats\nthat resulted in decreased viability, increased mortality, morphological\nchanges and the apoptosis of alveolar type II epithelial cells (AT-II), as\nwell as increased expression levels of AngII, AT1R and p22phox, which would\nultimately lead to secondary diseases. NK3201 significantly inhibited the\nhyperoxia-induced increased expression of AngII, AT1R and p22phox and further\npromoted OGG1 and PPARγ protein expression, thus reducing the intrapulmonary\nROS level, the apoptotic index and caspase-3 levels. However, the adult\nhyperoxia group only exhibited tachypnea and reduced viability. This study\nsuggested that the AngII-p22phox-ROS signaling pathway, PPARγ and OGG1\ntogether contributed to the hyperoxia-induced lung injury and that NK3201 was\nable to reverse the effects of hyperoxia.\n\n"}
