Zygotes were cryopreserved either by one of two\nvitrification protocols or by one of the two conventional freezing protocols.\nThe morphological survival rates of zygotes subjected to two-step freezing in\n1.5 M ethylene glycol and 0.1 M sucrose (74%) or to vitrification in 7.2 M\nethylene glycol and 1.0 M sucrose (81%) were higher than those subjected to\nfreezing in 1.5 M DMSO (46%) or to vitrification in a mixture of 2.0 M DMSO,\n1.0 M acetamide, and 3.0 M propylene glycol (41%). But the in vitro\ndevelopment into blastocysts of zygotes cryopreserved by vitrification (17%)\nor to a lesser extent by freezing (52%) was impaired, when compared to that of\nfresh control zygotes (89%). Next, a fusion gene composed from bovine\naS1-casein promoter and a human GH structural gene (2.8 kb) was microinjected\ninto the pronucleus of rabbit zygotes frozen-thawed in ethylene glycol and\nsucrose. Then, the presence of exogenous DNA in the genome of newborn\noffspring was determined by PCR. The post-injection survival of frozen zygotes\n(97%) was the same as that of fresh control zygotes (96%). However, of 18\noffspring derived from 414 frozen-thawed and DNA-injected zygotes, no\ntransgenic rabbits were produced. Of 52 offspring derived from 403 DNA-\ninjected fresh zygotes, 3 transgenic rabbits were found. Here we report the\nfirst rabbit offspring resulting from zygotes cryopreserved at the pronuclear-\nstage, although the cryopreservation procedure employed must be improved if\nzygotes are to be used for systematic production of transgenic rabbits.\n\n"}
