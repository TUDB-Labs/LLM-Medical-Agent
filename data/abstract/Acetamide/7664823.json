To this aim, we reexamined the heterogeneity of\ncortical GABAA receptors in self- and cross-competition binding experiments\nusing [3H]flunitrazepam and two ligands with higher affinity for\nbenzodiazepine BZ1 sites relative to benzodiazepine BZ2 sites, the\ntriazolopyridazine 3-methyl-6-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,2,4-triazolo\n[4,3-b] pyridazine (CL 218,872) and the imidazopyridine\nN,N,6-trimethyl-2-(4-methylphenyl)-imidazo[1,2-a]-pyridine-3-acetamide\nhemitartrate (zolpidem). Benzodiazepine BZ1 sites accounted for 52% of the\ntotal number of binding sites in adult rats, but were not detected in newborn\nrats. On the other hand, two classes of benzodiazepine BZ2 sites with high and\nlow affinity for zolpidem were present in newborn and adult rats. These sites\nwere designated as benzodiazepine BZ2H (high affinity for zolpidem, Kd\napproximately 150 nM) and benzodiazepine BZ2L (low affinity for zolpidem, Kd\napproximately 3000 nM). High densities of benzodiazepine BZ2H sites were\nmeasured in both newborn and adult rats (75% and 41% of the total number of\n[3H]flunitrazepam binding sites, respectively), whereas benzodiazepine BZ2L\nsites accounted for 25% and 7% of the total number of cortical sites in\nneonates and adults, respectively. Flunitrazepam, CL 218,872 and zolpidem\ninhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the binding of\n[35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) to the convulsant site of\ncortical GABAA receptors in newborn and adult rats. The IC50 for flunitrazepam\nwas about 3-fold greater in adults than in neonates. This rightward shift in\nthe concentration-response curve may be due to a decrease with age in the\nintrinsic efficacy of flunitrazepam. In contrast, CL 218,872 and zolpidem were\n4-fold more potent at inhibiting [35S]TBPS binding in adult rats relative to\nneonates. The different affinities of CL 218,872 and zolpidem for\nbenzodiazepine BZ1 and BZ2 receptors may account, at least in part, for the\nage-related changes in their inhibitory potencies. These results demonstrate\nthat benzodiazepine BZ2 sites mediate the modulation of [35S]TBPS binding by\nbenzodiazepine recognition site ligands in the cerebral cortex of newborn\nrats. Further, benzodiazepine BZ2 sites may be involved in the inhibition of\n[35S]TBPS binding by flunitrazepam, CL 218,872 and zolpidem in the cerebral\ncortex of adult rats.\n\n"}
