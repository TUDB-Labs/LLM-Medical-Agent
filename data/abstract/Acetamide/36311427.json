Although many efforts have\nbeen made to combat ZIKV infection, there is currently no approved vaccines or\nantiviral drugs available and there is an urgent need to develop effective\nanti-ZIKV agents. In this study, 26 acetylarylamine-S-DACOs derivatives were\nprepared, and eight of them were found to have inhibitory activity against\nZika virus. Among these substances,\n2-[(4-cyclohexyl-5-ethyl-6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyrimidin-2-yl)thio]-N-(3,5-difluorophenyl)acetamide\n(4w) with the best anti-ZIKV activity was selected for in-depth study of\nantiviral activity and mechanism of action. Here, we discovered 4w targeted on\nthe ZIKV NS5 RNA -dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which exhibited good in\nvitro antiviral activity without cell species specificity, both at the protein\nlevel and at the RNA level can significantly inhibit ZIKV replication.\nPreliminary molecular docking studies showed that 4w preferentially binds to\nthe palm region of NS5A RdRp through hydrogen bonding with residues such as\nLYS468, PHE466, GLU465, and GLY467. ZIKV NS5 RdRp enzyme activity experiment\nshowed that 4w could directly inhibit ZIKV RdRp activity with EC50 = 11.38 ±\n0.51 μM. In antiviral activity studies, 4w was found to inhibit ZIKV RNA\nreplication with EC50 = 6.87 ± 1.21 μM. ZIKV-induced plaque formation was\ninhibited with EC50 = 7.65 ± 0.31 μM. In conclusion, our study disclosed that\nacetylarylamine-S-DACOs is a new active scaffolds against ZIKV, among which\ncompound 4w was proved to be a potent novel anti-ZIKV compound target ZIKV\nRdRp protein. These promising results provide a future prospective for the\ndevelopment of ZIKV RdRp inhibitors.\n\n"}
