The compound was\noriginally found to be produced by peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes and\nthe T cell leukemia line Jurcat after long-term (18-24 h) incubation with\n[1-14C]AA. Compound 4 is also produced by lymphocytes, monocytes, platelets,\nthrombocytes, cultured fibroblasts and various types of malignant cell lines.\nWe purified this metabolite by means of high pressure liquid chromatography\nwith synchronous detection of radioactivity and measurement of ultraviolet-\nlight absorption at 278 nm. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and\nmass spectrometry with electron impact techniques demonstrated that compound 4\nis not an eicosanoid, but is identical to p-acetamidobenzoic acid (PACBA). The\ncells synthesize PACBA from p-aminobenzoic acid and a two-carbon residue from\nAA.\n\n"}
