Unexpectedly, electrophysiological recording from the\nneonatal rat spinal cord in vitro showed that, under control conditions, 1-60\nμM PJ-34 per se strongly increased spontaneous network discharges occurring\nsynchronously on ventral roots, persisting for 24 h even after PJ-34 washout.\nThe PARP-1 inhibitor PHE had no similar effect. The action by PJ-34 was\nreversibly suppressed by glutamate ionotropic receptor blockers and remained\nafter applying strychnine and bicuculline. Fictive locomotion evoked by\nneurochemicals or by dorsal root stimulation was present 24 h after PJ-34\napplication. In accordance with this observation, lumbar neurons and glia were\nundamaged. Neurochemical experiments showed that PJ-34 produced up to 33%\ninhibition of synaptosomal glutamate uptake with no effect on GABA uptake. In\nkeeping with this result, the glutamate uptake blocker TBOA (5 μM) induced\nlong-lasting synchronous discharges without suppressing the ability to produce\nfictive locomotion after 24 h. The novel inhibition of glutamate uptake by\nPJ-34 suggested that this effect may compound tests for its neuroprotective\nactivity which cannot be merely attributed to PARP-1 block. Furthermore, the\ncurrent data indicate that the neonatal rat spinal cord could withstand a\nstrong, long-lasting rise in network excitability without compromising\nlocomotor pattern generation or circuit structure in contrast with the damage\nto brain circuits known to be readily produced by persistent seizures.\n\n"}
