Worldwide, levetiracetam is most commonly approved\nas adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary\ngeneralization; other approved indications include monotherapy treatment of\npartial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization, and\nadjunctive treatment of myoclonic seizures associated with juvenile myoclonic\nepilepsy and primary generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures associated with\nidiopathic generalized epilepsy. Levetiracetam has a novel structure and\nunique mechanisms of action. Unlike other AEDs, the mechanisms of action of\nlevetiracetam appear to involve neuronal binding to synaptic vesicle protein\n2A, inhibiting calcium release from intraneuronal stores, opposing the\nactivity of negative modulators of GABA- and glycin-gated currents and\ninhibiting excessive synchronized activity between neurons. In addition,\nlevetiracetam inhibits N-type calcium channels. Levetiracetam is associated\nwith rapid and complete absorption, high oral bioavailability, minimal\nmetabolism that consists of hydrolysis of the acetamide group and primarily\nrenal elimination. It lacks cytochrome P450 isoenzyme-inducing potential and\nis not associated with clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions\nwith other drugs, including other AEDs. The efficacy of oral immediate-release\nlevetiracetam in controlling seizures has been established in numerous\nrandomized, double-blind, controlled, multicentre trials in patients with\nepilepsy. Adjunctive levetiracetam reduced the frequency of seizures in\npaediatric and adult patients with refractory partial-onset seizures to a\nsignificantly greater extent than placebo. Monotherapy with levetiracetam was\nnoninferior to that with carbamazepine controlled release in controlling\nseizures in patients with newly diagnosed partial-onset seizures.\nLevetiracetam also provided seizure control relative to placebo as adjunctive\ntherapy in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy with myoclonic\nseizures or GTC seizures. In addition, patients receiving oral levetiracetam\nshowed improvements in measures of health-related quality of life relative to\nthose receiving placebo. Although treatment-emergent adverse events were\ncommonly reported in the clinical trials of levetiracetam, the overall\nproportion of patients who experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse\nevent was broadly similar in the levetiracetam and placebo treatment groups,\nwith most events being mild to moderate in severity. Levetiracetam is not\nassociated with cognitive impairment or drug-induced weight gain, but has been\nassociated with behavioural adverse effects in some patients.\n\n"}
