{"title": "Effects of piracetam on brain development in newborn rats exposed to hypoxia\n\n", "doi": "\n\n", "time": "1984;43(6):789-95.\n\n", "abstract": "Perinatal hypoxia is one of the main causes of disturbances of the function of\nthe CNS during childhood. In this study the protective effect of the nootropic\ndrug piracetam (oxo-2-pyrrolidinyl-1)-2-acetamide was tested. One-day-old\nWistar rats were exposed together with their mothers to hypoxia up to the 10th\nday of life (11 h daily, pO2 = 9.86 kPa). On the 11th day a 48% decrease of\nbody weight and a 30% decrease of brain weight was found in the hypoxic\nanimals. The protein/DNA ratio and the AChE activity in the brain cortex were\ndecreased indicating retarded brain development. Piracetam (daily 100 mg/kg,\ns. c., before hypoxic exposure) did not affect the mortality rate, the somatic\ndevelopment of the animals, or the estimated basic neurochemical markers in\nthe cortex of the brain. At the age of 3 months the fractional efflux rate\n(FER) of dopamine (DA) evoked chemically or electrically as a characteristic\nfunctional feature of chemical synaptic transmission, was examined. It was\nfound that postnatal hypoxia induces a long lasting increase of FER of DA of\nstriatum slices. Animals exposed postnatally to hypoxia and treated with\npiracetam showed an increased FER of DA (potassium as stimulus) by comparison\nwith those animals also exposed postnatally to hypoxia but left untreated with\npiracetam.\n\n"}
