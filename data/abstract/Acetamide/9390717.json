After washing with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, hair samples\n(10 mg) were added with deuterated internal standards, extracted by 1-h\nsonication and over night soaking in 2 ml of 5 M HCl-methanol (1:20) at room\ntemperature. Following evaporation of the liquid phase, the residue was\ndissolved in phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.0) and purified using a solid-\nphase extraction procedure with Bond Elut Certify columns. Two types of\nderivatization were compared - using trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA) and\npentafluoropropionic anhydride (PFPA) - for discrimination of EP and\nmethamphetamine (MA). Derivatized extracts were analyzed by GC-MS in the EI\nmode using a capillary column (OV-1 equivalent). From the results comparing\nthree GC-MS conditions, PFP-derivatives separated with a temperature gradient\nof 20 degrees C/min from 60 degrees C to 280 degrees C gave the best\nresolution between EP and MA. ME was analyzed as a trimethylsilyl derivative\nusing N,O-bis-trimethylsilyl acetamide at the above GC condition. The assay\nwas linear from 0.5 to 50 ng/mg (r=0.998) and capable of detecting less than\n50 pg of derivatized EP, PPA and ME on-column. Intra-assay precision was\ncharacterized by C.V. values from 5 to 16% in the concentration range of 1-10\nng/mg hair. The method was used for the quantitative determination of EP, PPA\nand ME in the hair obtained from three rats with dark brown hair after ten\nintraperitoneal injections (5 mg/kg/day) of the three drugs and from three\nmale and one female volunteers with black hair after an oral dose of 50 mg/day\nof EP-HCl for three days. Hair samples were collected by shaving from the back\nof rats and cutting from the scalp of humans 28 days after the first dose. The\nincorporation rates of EP, PPA and ME into hair (the ratios of [hair\nconcentration] to [AUC]) obtained from the animal experiment were 0.10, 0.07\nand 0.03, respectively, which are a little lower than those (0.14, 0.10 and\n0.04) of their desoxy-compounds, MA, amphetamine and dimethylamphetamine. EP\nwas detected at an average of 2.25 ng/mg (n=4) in human scalp hair and at a\nrange of 1-29 ng/mg (n=3) in human beard hair until day 14, but its metabolite\n(PPA) was at a trace level in the hair of the four subjects. The method was\nsuccessfully used for detection of ME and EP in the hair of a neonate and its\nmother who was abusing Bron syrup containing ME during the pregnancy.\n\n"}
