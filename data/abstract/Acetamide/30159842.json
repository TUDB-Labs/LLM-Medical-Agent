However,\nmost studies focused on the criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2,\nSO2, CO, and Pb), and only a few studies examined the potential impact of\nother air pollutants on LBW. This study investigated associations between\nmaternal residential exposure to industrial air emissions of 449 toxics\nrelease inventory (TRI) chemicals and LBW in offspring using a case-control\nstudy design based on a large dataset consisting of 94,106 LBW cases and\n376,424 controls in Texas from 1996 to 2008. Maternal residential exposure to\nchemicals was estimated using a modified version of the emission-weighted\nproximity model (EWPM). The model takes into account reported quantities of\nannual air emission from industrial facilities and the distances between the\nlocations of industrial facilities and maternal residence locations. Binary\nlogistic regression was used to compute odds ratios measuring the association\nbetween maternal exposure to different TRI chemicals and LBW in offspring.\nOdds ratios were adjusted for child's sex, birth year, gestational length,\nmaternal age, education, race/ethnicity, and public health region of maternal\nresidence. Among the ten chemicals selected for a complete analysis, maternal\nresidential exposures to five TRI chemicals were positively associated with\nLBW in offspring. These five chemicals include acetamide (adjusted odds ratio\n[aOR] 2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24, 4.20), p-phenylenediamine (aOR\n1.63, 95% CI 1.18, 2.25), 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (aOR 1.41, 95% CI\n1.20, 1.66), tributyltin methacrylate (aOR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06, 1.36), and\n1,1,1-trichloroethane (aOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03, 1.20). These findings suggest\nthat maternal residential proximity to industrial air emissions of some\nchemicals during pregnancy may be associated with LBW in offspring.\n\n"}
