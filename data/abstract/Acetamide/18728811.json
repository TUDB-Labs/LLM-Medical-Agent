{"title": "Monotherapy for partial epilepsy: focus on levetiracetam\n\n", "doi": "PMC2515905\n\n", "time": "2008 Feb;4(1):33-8.\n\n", "abstract": "Levetiracetam (LEV), the S-enantiomer of alpha-ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrollidine\nacetamide, is a recently licensed antiepileptic drug (AED) for adjunctive\ntherapy of partial seizures. Its mechanism of action is uncertain but it\nexhibits a unique profile of anticonvulsant activity in models of chronic\nepilepsy. Five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials enrolling\nadult or pediatric patients with refractory partial epilepsy have demonstrated\nthe efficacy of LEV as adjunctive therapy, with a responder rate (>/=50%\nreduction in seizure frequency) of 28%-45%. Long-term efficacy studies suggest\nretention rates of 60% after one year, with 13% of patients seizure-free for 6\nmonths of the study and 8% seizure-free for 1 year. More recent studies\nillustrated successful conversion to monotherapy in patients with refractory\nepilepsy, and its effectiveness as a single agent in partial epilepsy. LEV has\nalso efficacy in generalized epilepsies. Adverse effects of LEV, including\nsomnolence, lethargy, and dizziness, are generally mild and their occurrence\nrate seems to be not significantly different from that observed in placebo\ngroups. LEV also has no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions\nwith other AEDs, or with commonly prescribed medications. The combination of\neffective antiepileptic properties with a relatively mild adverse effect\nprofile makes LEV an attractive therapy for partial seizures.\n\n"}
