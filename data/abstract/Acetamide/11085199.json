A review of its adjunctive use in the management of partial\nonset seizures\n\n", "doi": "10.2165/00003495-200060040-00004\n\n", "time": "2000 Oct;60(4):871-93.\n\n", "abstract": "Levetiracetam, the S-enantiomer of alpha-ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrollidine acetamide,\nis approved for use as adjunctive therapy in adult patients with partial onset\nseizures. Oral levetiracetam 1000, 2000 and 3000 mg/day administered as\nadjunctive therapy for up to 18 weeks significantly increased responder rates\nand reduced seizure frequency compared with placebo in 3 well designed pivotal\ntrials in adults with treatment-refractory partial seizures with or without\nsecondary generalisation. Levetiracetam 3000 mg/day also significantly\nincreased the number of seizure-free patients, but the effects of\nlevetiracetam 1000 and 2000 mg/day on this end-point were unclear. Effects on\nseizure severity were not assessed in these trials. Although not yet approved\nas monotherapy or for use in paediatric patients, efficacy was observed with\nlevetiracetam 3000 mg/day as monotherapy in adult patients with refractory\npartial seizures with or without secondary generalisation and with the 10 to\n40 mg/kg/day dosage as adjunctive therapy in children with refractory partial\nseizures. However, these data are limited. Oral levetiracetam 1000, 2000 and\n3000 mg/day as adjunctive therapy is generally well tolerated with an overall\nincidence of adverse events similar to that observed with placebo. The most\ncommonly reported events in individual clinical trials were CNS-related and\nincluded somnolence, asthenia, headache and dizziness. Levetiracetam\nadministered as adjunctive therapy does not appear to interact with other\nanticonvulsant drugs, and no clinically relevant interactions were observed\nbetween levetiracetam and digoxin, warfarin or probenecid; oral contraceptive\nprotective efficacy was also not affected by levetiracetam. Conclusions:\nLevetiracetam is a new anticonvulsant agent with a favourable tolerability\nprofile and a low potential for drug interactions. It has shown efficacy as\nadjunctive therapy in patients with treatment-refractory partial onset\nseizures with or without secondary generalisation in clinical trials. Direct\ncomparative trials with other anticonvulsant agents are not yet available, but\nplacebo-controlled clinical evidence to date suggests that levetiracetam\n(1000, 2000 and 3000 mg/day) is a useful option as adjunctive therapy in\npatients with this subtype of epilepsy.\n\n"}
