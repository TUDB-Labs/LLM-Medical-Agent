{"title": "[Detection of minimal residual disease in Ewing's sarcoma using RT-PCR]\n\n", "doi": "\n\n", "time": "2000 Nov 8;139(22):685-9.\n\n", "abstract": "Background: More than 90% of Ewing's sarcomas (ES) contain a fusion of the EWS\nand FLI-1 genes, due to the t(11;22)(q23;q12) translocation. At the molecular\nlevel, the EWS-FLI-1 rearrangement shows great diversity. Specifically, many\ndifferent combinations of exons from EWS-FLI-1 encode in-frame fusion\ntranscripts and result in differences in length and composition of the\nchimeric protein, which function as an oncogenic aberrant transcription\nfactor. The finding of this translocation gives evidence for the presence of\nES cells. The aim of this prospective study was to verify applicability of the\nRT-PCR method for the detection of minimal residual disease in patients with\nES. Methods and results: Conditions for the detection of Ewing's sarcoma cells\nby means of the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at\nfusion transcripts in peripheral blood, bone marrow (BM) and autologous\nhematopoietic stem cell grafts in patients with ES were appointed. 31 samples\nof BM, 5 samples of blood and 7 peripheral blood grafts obtained from 23\npatients were investigated. Presence of tumor cells was identified in 7 BM\nsamples from 7 different patients (31 samples from 16 patients), all the\nperipheral blood and graft samples were negative. Conclusions: The high\nsensitivity of RT-PCR method in detection of cells bearing t(11;22)(q23;q12)\nwas demonstrated in the experimental model and clinical samples. Likewise the\nliterary statements, the RT-PCR method was found to be more sensitive than\ncytology.\n\n"}
