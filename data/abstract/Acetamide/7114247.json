Brain permeabilities of\n14C-labeled test isotopes were measured relative to that of tritiated water, a\nhighly diffusible reference substance, with correction for any test isotope\nremaining in the cerebral vasculature. The brain uptake indices of acetamide,\nantipyrine, benzyl alcohol, butanol, caffeine, cytosine, diphenyl hydantoin,\nethanol, ethylene glycol, heroin, mannitol, methanol, phenobarbital, propylene\nglycol, thiourea, and urea were measured in ether-anesthetized newborn\nrabbits. A highly significant correlation (r = 0.86) between brain uptake\nindices and octanol-saline partition coefficients of these compounds was\nobserved. An almost identical relationship was derived in the adult rat blood-\nbrain barrier where brain uptakes and partition coefficients of some 48\ncompounds could be correlated (r = 0.86). The similarities in slope-intercept\nrelationships indicate that newborn rabbit and adult rat brain endothelia are\nfunctionally similar with respect to lipid-mediated permeability [in contrast\nto previous studies that have established dramatic differences in selective\npermeabilities of metabolites transported by saturable, carrier-mediated\n(\"facilitated diffusion\") mechanisms]. Permeability-surface area products were\nalso derived; these data confirmed no differences in permeability could be\ndetected between newborn and adult blood-brain-barrier capillaries. A\nrelationship between hydrogen bond number (an alternative indicator of\nhydrophobic properties( and brain uptake indices derived for the adult rat\nbrain could not be confirmed in the case of the newborn rabbit.\n\n"}
