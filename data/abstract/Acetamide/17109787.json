PT can be symptomatic (SPT) or essential (EPT). The\nsymptomatic form usually occurs in adults and the essential form mainly occurs\nin children. Several different treatments for EPT in children appear in the\nliterature with variable reported efficacy. This report details four\npaediatric patients with EPT (three males, one female; mean age 6y 4mo [SD\n6mo]; age at onset 6-7y) treated with piracetam (2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine\nacetamide). Piracetam was used to treat EPT because of its antimyoclonic\nproperties. All children showed a good response to doses of 100 to\n300mg/kg/day. EPT relapsed on withdrawal of piracetam and remitted on\nreintroduction. Piracetam's effect on EPT was sustained. It is concluded that\npiracetam is an effective drug for the treatment of EPT in children.\n\n"}
