Twenty-three granulosa cell tumors (GCT; eight juvenile and 15\nadult type) were studied in comparison with non-neoplastic granulosa cells of\nhuman ovaries. In all 23 cases of GCT, chondroitin 6-sulfate proteoglycan\nrevealed with antibody 3B3 was characteristically observed in the\nextracellular matrix in the solid nest, as well as in microfollicles. In the\njuvenile cases, the extracellular matrix also contained large proteoglycan\n(PG) revealed with antibody 2B1. Macrofollicles as well as microfollicles\ncontained PG chondroitin 6-sulfate side chains with a significant amount of\nchondroitin 4-sulfate. By biochemical analysis using high pressure liquid\nchromatography, it was also found that disaccharide composition of\nglycosaminoglycan fractions extracted from granulosa cell tumor tissues\nconsisted mainly of 2-acetamide-2-deoxyl-3-O-(beta-D-\ngluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-D-galactose (delta Di-6S). The\ncharacteristic feature of granulosa cell tumors is the accumulation of\nchondroitin sulfate PG, especially chondroitin 6-sulfate PG, which may be\nsynthesized by the tumor cells themselves. Immunohistochemical\ncharacterization of the extracellular matrix components (collagen, laminin,\nheparan sulfate PG, chondroitin 4-sulfate PG) was also studied in relation to\nchondroitin 6-sulfate PG localization.\n\n"}
