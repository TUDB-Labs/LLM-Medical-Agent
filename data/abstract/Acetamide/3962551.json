Acidimetric titration of rat serum\nwith and without added bilirubin shows that binding of bilirubin acid in the\nrange of pH from 6.8 to 8.8 takes place with release of less than one hydrogen\nion per molecule of bound bilirubin. With human serum, two hydrogen ions are\nreleased, indicating binding of bilirubin dianion. The binding equilibrium of\nN-[4-[(4-aminophenyl)-sulfonyl]phenyl]-acetamide (MADDS) to rat serum albumin\nis influenced slightly by cobinding of bilirubin whereas MADDS and bilirubin\nbind competitively to human serum albumin. Finally, the rate of oxidation of\nbilirubin with hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase is decreased moderately by\naddition of rat serum albumin and strongly by the human protein, indicating\nthat biliribin in its complex with rat serum albumin is subject to oxidation\nwhile the complex with human serum albumin is protected. These differences\nshould be considered when rats are used as a model in experimental studies\naiming at prevention of bilirubin encephalopathy in human neonates.\n\n"}
