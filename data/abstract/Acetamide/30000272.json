{"title": "Colchicine\n\n", "doi": "NBK501213\n\n", "time": "\n\n", "abstract": "Long-term prophylactic maternal doses of colchicine up to 1.5 mg daily produce\nlevels in milk that result in the infant receiving less than 10% of the\nmaternal weight-adjusted dosage. The highest milk levels occur 2 to 4 hours\nafter a dose, so avoiding breastfeeding during this time can minimize the\ninfant dose, although some clinicians simply recommend taking the drug after\nnursing. No adverse effects in breastfed infants have been reported in case\nseries and a case-control study and many experts and professional guidelines\nconsider colchicine safe during breastfeeding in women being treated for\nfamilial Mediterranean fever or rheumatic conditions.[1-5]\n\n"}
