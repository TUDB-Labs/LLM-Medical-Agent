Several\nagents have been tried for treatment, often limited by toxic side effects.\nPiracetam (2-oxo-l-pyrrolidine acetamide, Nootropyl), a cyclic derivative of\ngamma-amino butyrate, used for the treatment of psychosenescent syndromes with\nno known side effects, was considered as a possible therapeutic agent for\nsickle cell disease. Interest was focused on the use of piracetam when it was\nshown that it had an antisickling effect, both in vivo and in vitro. We\ninitiated multicentre double-blind investigations in two groups of children\nsuffering from sickle cell disease ranging in age from 3-6 to 6-12 years. The\ntotal number of patients included in the study were 87 (SCA = 79 and Hb S beta\ndegree-thal. = 8) in 13 centres in 10 different regions of Saudi Arabia. Coded\nboxes of the drugs were received from the company (UCB) and were administered\nas intravenous infusion during crises and orally during the follow-up, for a\nperiod of up to 1 year. After decoding the code at the end of the study, the\npatients were grouped into those receiving placebo (n = 39), i.e. controls, or\npiracetam (n = 48), i.e. study cases. In terms of age, weight, height and\nseverity index, number of blood transfusions received and number of\nhospitalization, both groups were statistically homogenous. Data analysis\nshowed that the clinical severity of the disease, the number of crises, the\nextent of hospitalization and the blood transfusion requirements significantly\ndecreased during piracetam treatment (p < 0.001), though no statistically\nsignificant changes occurred in the placebo group. However, in the levels of\nthe haematological and biochemical parameters no significant changes were\ndocumented in both groups. In addition, the improvement in the clinical\npresentation of the disease continued even several months after\ndiscontinuation of the drug in the majority of the children, as judged from\nthe low severity index value. Though our results point to the recommendation\nthat piracetam can be used for the treatment of children suffering from sickle\ncell disease, both SCA and S beta degree-thal, it is advisable to conduct\nlong-term and close follow-up treatment programmes using piracetam to\nestablish its therapeutic value particularly in adults and to ascertain that\nthere are no long-term toxic side effects.\n\n"}
