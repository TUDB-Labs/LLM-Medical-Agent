The effects of opioid receptor agonists and antagonists on the breathing\npattern of neonatal rats were studied. Three experimental approaches were\ntaken. In the first approach, the effects of opioid agonists and antagonists\non the spontaneous respiratory neural activity generated by brainstem-spinal\ncords isolated from neonatal rats aged 0-4 days postnatal (P0-4) maintained in\nvitro were studied. Secondly, similar studies were performed utilizing\nmedullary slice preparations consisting of respiratory rhythm-generating\nregions (pre-Bötzinger complex). Thirdly, whole-body plethysmographic\nrecordings were obtained from unanaesthetized neonatal (P0-18) rats before and\nafter I.P. administration of opioid-receptor agonists and antagonists. 2. The\nmu-receptor agonists morphiceptin and DAGO (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-[NMePhe]-Gly-ol),\nwhen added either to the solutions bathing the brainstems of neonatal rat\nbrainstem-spinal cord preparations or bathing the medullary slice\npreparations, resulted in a naloxone-reversible, dose-dependent decrease in\nthe frequency of respiratory rhythmic discharge. 3. The respiratory burst\nfrequency and amplitude in vitro were unaffected by the addition of the delta-\nopioid receptor agonist DPDPE ([D-pen2,5]-enkephalin) and the kappa-opioid\nreceptor agonist U50488 (trans-[+]-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-(2-[1-\npyrrolidinyl]cyclohexyl) benzene-acetamide) or the opioid receptor antagonist\nnaloxone. 4. Intraperitoneal administration of the mu-opioid receptor agonist\nfentanyl resulted in a naloxone-reversible, dose-dependent decrease in the\nfrequency and amplitude of breathing of unanaesthetized neonatal rats\n(P0-P10). I.P. administration of the delta-opioid receptor agonist DPDPE did\nnot affect breathing of neonatal rats until the second week postnatally. 5. We\nconclude that opioids suppress the frequency of neonatal rat respiration by\nacting via mu-opioid receptors located within regions of the ventral medulla\ncontaining respiratory rhythm-generating centres (the pre-Bötzinger complex).\ndelta-Opioid receptor activation does not affect breathing in neonatal rats\nuntil approximately the second week postnatally.\n\n"}
