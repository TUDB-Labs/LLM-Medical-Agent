{"title": "Recurrent urinary tract infections in children: Preventive interventions other\nthan prophylactic antibiotics\n\n", "doi": "PMC4482817\n\n", "time": "2015 Jun 26;5(2):13-9.\n\n", "abstract": "Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common childhood infections.\nPermanent renal cortical scarring may occur in affected children, especially\nwith recurrent UTIs, leading to long-term complications such as hypertension\nand chronic renal failure. To prevent such damage, several interventions to\nprevent UTI recurrences have been tried. The most established and accepted\nprevention at present is low dose long-term antibiotic prophylaxis. However it\nhas a risk of break through infections, adverse drug reactions and also the\nrisk of developing antibiotic resistance. The search is therefore on-going to\nfind a safer, effective and acceptable alternative. A recent meta-analysis did\nnot support routine circumcision for normal boys with no risk factors.\nVaccinium Macrocarpon (cranberry), commonly used against UTI in adult women,\nis also effective in reducing the number of recurrences and related\nantimicrobial use in children. Sodium pentosanpolysulfate, which prevents\nbacterial adherence to the uroepithelial cells in animal models, has shown\nconflicting results in human trials. When combined with antibiotic,\nLactobacillus acidophilus (LA-5) and Bifidobacterium, by blocking the in vitro\nattachment of uropathogenic bacteria to uroepithelial cells, significantly\nreduce in the incidence of febrile UTIs. Deliberate colonization of the human\nurinary tract of patients with recurrent UTI with Escherichia-coli (E. coli)\n83972 has resulted in subjective benefit and less UTI requiring treatment. The\nnon-pathogenic E. coli isolate NU14 DeltawaaL is a candidate to develop live-\nattenuated vaccine for the treatment and prevention of acute and recurrent\nUTI. Diagnosing and treating dysfunctional elimination syndromes decrease the\nincidence of recurrent UTI. A meta-analysis found the lack of robust\nprospective randomized controlled trials limited the strength of the\nestablished guidelines for surgical management of vesicoureteral reflux. In\nconclusion, several interventions, other than antibiotic prophylaxis, for the\nprevention of recurrent UTI have been tried and, although showing some\npromise, they do not provide so far a definitive effective answer. Finding\nsuitable alternatives still requires further high quality research of those\nseemingly promising interventions.\n\n"}
