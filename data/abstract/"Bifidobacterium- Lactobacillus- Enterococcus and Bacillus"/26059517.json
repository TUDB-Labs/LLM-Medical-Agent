The aim of this study was to investigate the role of MUC2 in\nblocking effects of probiotics on meningitic E. coli-induced pathogenicities.\nIn this study, live combined probiotic tablets containing living\nBifidobacterium, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus were\nused. MUC2 expression was knocked down in Caco-2 cells by RNA interference.\n5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), which enhances mucin-promoted probiotic\neffects through inducing production of Sadenosyl- L-methionine (SAMe), was\nused to up-regulate MUC2 expression in Caco-2 cells. The adhesion to and\ninvasion of meningitic E. coli were detected by competition assays. Our\nstudies showed that probiotic agents could block E. coli-caused intestinal\ncolonization, bacteremia, and meningitis in a neonatal sepsis and meningitis\nrat model. MUC2 gene expression in the neonatal rats given probiotic agents\nwas obviously higher than that of the infected and uninfected control groups\nwithout probiotic treatment. The prohibitive effects of probiotic agents on\nMUC2-knockdown Caco-2 cells infected with E44 were significantly reduced\ncompared with nontransfected Caco-2 cells. Moreover, the results also showed\nthat 5- Aza-CdR, a drug enhancing the production of SAMe that is a protective\nagent of probiotics, was able to significantly suppress adhesion and invasion\nof E44 to Caco-2 cells by upregulation of MUC2 expression. Taken together, our\ndata suggest that probiotic agents can efficiently block meningitic E. coli-\ninduced pathogenicities in a manner dependent on MUC2.\n\n"}
